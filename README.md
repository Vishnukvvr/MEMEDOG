# MEMEDOG

- Memes can be filtered based on categories like Trending, New, Classic, and Random.
- Sorting options allow users to sort memes by likes or date.

### Like & Comment System

- Users can add comments to memes, which are stored locally and displayed under the respective meme.

### Download Memes
- Users can download memes by clicking the ‚¨áÔ∏è button.
- The app generates a download link for the meme image, allowing users to save it locally.

### Infinite Scrolling & Pagination
